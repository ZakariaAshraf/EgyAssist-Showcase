> **⚠️ Note to Recruiters & Reviewers:** > The full source code for this repository is kept **Private** because it is a live production application on Google Play containing active Firebase API keys, Shorebird OTA configurations, and Google AdMob IDs. This repository serves as a **Showcase** detailing the architecture, features, and UI/UX. I am more than happy to discuss the BLoC implementation, Clean Architecture principles, and code structure in detail during an interview.

## 📖 The Story Behind EgyAssist

As a Computer Science graduate from Egypt looking to pursue a Master's degree in **Software Engineering**, **Cloud Computing**, or **Data Science** in Europe — specifically Germany and Austria — I faced a massive, frustrating challenge.

Information about university requirements, application portals, deadlines, and language certificates is **extremely scattered**. Every university has a different website, different requirements, and different policies.

The biggest pain point? **The Language Requirement.**

Many students with English-taught Bachelor's degrees struggle with the time and cost of standard English tests (IELTS/TOEFL). Some European universities accept the previous degree as proof of language — known as **MOI (Medium of Instruction)** — but finding which universities actually accept MOI is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

> **EgyAssist was built to solve exactly this.** It aggregates real program data, filters out the noise, and gives students direct, actionable information — with a dedicated **MOI Accepted** filter that saves months of research.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `>=3.8.1`
- Dart SDK `>=3.x`
- A Firebase project (Firestore + Firebase Auth enabled)
- A Google AdMob account (optional for development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZakariaAshraf/egyassist.git
cd egyassist
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add an Android app (`com.egyassist.app`) and an iOS app (`com.egyassist.app`)
3. Download `google-services.json` → place in `android/app/`
4. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` → place in `ios/Runner/`
5. Run FlutterFire CLI to generate `lib/firebase_options.dart`:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

6. Enable **Email/Password** authentication in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in methods
7. Create a **Firestore** database and set up your programs collection

### 4. AdMob setup (optional)

- Replace ad unit IDs in `lib/core/services/ad_manger.dart` with your own
- For testing, set `isTest = true` in `AdManger` to use Google test ad IDs

### 5. Run the app

```bash
flutter run
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

EgyAssist uses **Codemagic** for automated builds and deployments, connected to this GitHub repository.

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Push to `main` | Build Android AAB (release, signed) |
| Push to `main` | Build iOS IPA (release, signed) |
| Manual trigger | Deploy to Google Play / App Store |

**Secrets managed in Codemagic:**
- `google-services.json` (base64 encoded)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (base64 encoded)
- `firebase_options.dart`
- Android release keystore + passwords
- iOS distribution certificate + provisioning profile

---

## 📦 Key Dependencies

```yaml
firebase_core: ^4.x          # Firebase initialization
firebase_auth: ^6.x          # Email/password auth
cloud_firestore: ^6.x        # Realtime database
flutter_bloc: ^9.x           # Cubit / BLoC state management
flutter_riverpod: ^3.x       # Theme and locale global state
shared_preferences: ^2.x     # Local cache (guest mode, theme, language, uId)
google_mobile_ads: ^6.x      # Banner and interstitial ads
onesignal_flutter: ^5.x      # Push notifications
persistent_bottom_nav_bar: ^6.x  # Bottom navigation
connectivity_plus: ^7.x      # Offline detection
flutter_localizations:         # EN + AR localization
```

---

## 🌐 Localization

The app supports **English** and **Arabic (RTL)** fully. All strings are managed via Flutter's ARB system:

```
lib/l10n/
├── app_en.arb       # English strings
├── app_ar.arb       # Arabic strings
└── app_localizations.dart  # Generated (do not edit manually)
```

To add a new string:
1. Add the key/value to both `app_en.arb` and `app_ar.arb`
2. Run `flutter gen-l10n`
3. Use `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.yourKey` in the widget

---

## 🔒 Guest Mode

Users can enter the app without creating an account by tapping **"Continue as a Guest"**.

- Guest state is persisted via `CacheKeys.isGuestMode` (SharedPreferences)
- Restricted sections (Profile, Bookmarks, Saved Programs, User Info) show a **blur overlay** with a "You must create an account to access this section" message and Sign In / Create Account buttons
- On successful sign-in or registration, the guest flag is cleared and full access is restored
- The root navigator is used for navigation from the overlay to avoid conflicts with the nested tab navigator
